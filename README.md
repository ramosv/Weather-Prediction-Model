# Colorado Climate Forecast

## Overview

The following project is aimed at using historical weather data from the National Center for Environmental Information to predict future temperature trends in the state of Colorado. By analyzing past patterns and changes in temperature, our goal is to provide insights into what the future climate of Colorado may look like, particularly in the context of global warming and environmental changes.

## Use of README file.

I will be using this README as a way to log my progress and thought process throughout this project. This includes: posting insights, data challenges, model selection and interpreting results and findings with graphs.

## Notes on the data

Historical weather data came from the [National Center for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/)

We used Local Climatological Data (LCD), which consist of measurements taken multiple times a day, amounting to over 100,000 entries per year.

#### Missing Data: Denver-2013 and Alamosa-2014

We encountered missing data for Denver in 2013 and Alamosa in 2014. For Denver, we used data fromDENVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, CO US (Station ID: WBAN:03017). Despite efforts, the data for 2013 was not available. Similarly, data for ALAMOSA BERGMAN FIELD, CO US (Station ID: WBAN:23061) was missing for 2014.

#### Addressing Missing Data

We used data from adjacent years (2012 and 2014 for Denver, 2013 and 2015 for Alamosa) to predict the missing years. The graphs below show the estimated monthly average temperatures for these missing years.

Here are the results of estimating what the year 2013 in Denver would look like by taking daily average from 2012 and 2014.

Here are the results of estimating what the year 2014 in Alamosa would look like by taking daily average from 2013 and 2015.

#### Graphs representing Monthly Temperatures of all 4 locations used in this project. Graphing large data sets is a good way to make sure it is consistent and there are no missing values.

### Fixing Issue "Calculating high and low temperatures from daily averages"
Addressing the latest issue generated some expected problems in missingData.py, preprocessing.py and model.py files.

By closing the issue and addressing the main concern of missing Min and Max values for the mode. A new problem was generated in the initial steps of preprocessing, specifucally regarding missing data from Denver 2013 and Alamosa 2014. I have fix this problem in the latest push. Below is a graph of missing years data with min and max values.

Fixing the issue also rendered some, not all, of the graphing funcions useless. I have commmented them out for now.

### Final Check for all locations making sure there are no 'Holes' in the data.

## Moving forward with a different model: Seasonal Autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA)

In parameter optimization, them parameter is used for season period. Ideally I would like to select daily or m = 365 since our data is sampled that way. But it is very computational expensive.

After swtiching the data from daily to monthly. The model did well at figuring out the seasonality in the data with a resonable fit time of around 10 seconds. These are the results for "Grand min" and for "Grand max"

Grand min
- Best model: ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,0,1)[12] intercept
- Total fit time: 8.894 seconds
- Optimal SARIMA model order (p,d,q) (1, 0, 0)
- Optimal seasonal order: (1, 0, 1, 12)
- Test RMSE: 2.770376983204725

Grand max
- Best model: ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,0,1)[12] intercept
- Total fit time: 11.989 seconds
- Optimal SARIMA model order (p,d,q) (1, 0, 0)
- Optimal seasonal order: (1, 0, 1, 12)
- Test RMSE: 3.196960343446114

Meaning that the model was able to predict with a 2-3 degree differences from the train set.

The library documentation: https://alkaline-ml.com/pmdarima/modules/generated/pmdarima.arima.auto_arima.html

A built in funcion from the library 'plot_diagnostics' provided four different plots from the after the model has been trained.

For each data point, the residual is calculated as:
Residual = Observed Value âˆ’ Predicted Value

In a perfect model all residuals would be zero, meaning prediction match the data perfectly. (Residual = error)

1. Standarized Residual
    - This shows the residuals of the model over time (standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the residuals). 
    - Ideally the residuals would be normally distrubted. This means little to no correlation. Any noticiable pattern means that the model has not picked up on any trends.
2. Histogram plus estimated density
    - The N(0,1) shows the distribution of the standardized residuals, compared with a standard normal distribution
    - KDE should ideally follow the normal distribution.
    - Diviations from the normal distribution indicate the residuals negatively affected the model
3. normal Q-Q
    - a Quantile-Quantile plot that compares the distribution of the standardized residuals to a normal distribution.
    - The goal would be for the pointas to follow the red line representing a normal distribution for the residuals.
4. Correlogram
    - Correlation of the residuals with their own lagged values.
    - Correlations within the blue area indicate no significant correlation.
    - spikes could reveal autocorrelation missed by the model
